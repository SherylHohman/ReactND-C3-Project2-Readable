# Readable

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React-Redux course, as part of the React NanoDegree.

Readable is  a content and comment web app. 

Users can:  
- post content to predefined categories, 
- comment on their posts and other users' posts, and 
- vote on posts and comments. 
- edit and delete their own posts and comments.

UI includes the ability to:  
- sort by data, and author
- filter posts by category

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that interacts with the front-end portion of the app.

## Getting Started

To run Readable:

* In a terminal window, install and start the API server:
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install` or `yarn install` or just `yarn`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install the Readable App, and start the front-end server:
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install` or `yarn install` or just `yarn`
    - `npm start` or `yarn start`
    
After the first time, repeat the steps above to start both servers   
(ie do not run the commands `npm install` or `yarn install` or `yarn`)

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
